            <p>Cubbon Park, officially Sri Chamarajendra Park, is a landmark park in Bengaluru, located in the heart of
                the city in the Central Administrative Area. Originally created in 1870 under Major General Richard

            <p>Cubbon Park, officially Sri Chamarajendra Park,[1] is a landmark park in Bengaluru, located in the heart
                of the city in the Central Administrative Area. Originally created in 1870 under Major General Richard
                Sankey, then British Chief Engineer of Mysore State, it covered an area of 100 acres (0.40 km2).
                Subsequent expansion has since taken place and the park's area is now reported to be 300 acres (1.2
                km2).[2] It has a rich recorded history of abundant flora and fauna plantations coupled with numerous
                impressive and aesthetically located buildings and statues of famous personages, in its precincts.[3][4]

                This public park was first named as Meade's Park after Sir John Meade, the acting commissioner of Mysuru
                in 1870 and subsequently renamed as Cubbon Park after the longest-serving commissioner of the time, Sir
                Mark Cubbon. To commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar's rule in Mysore State, in
                1927, the park was again renamed as Sri. Chamarajendra Park, in memory of the 19th-century ruler of the
                state Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (1868–94), during whose rule the park came into existence.[5]

                The landscaping in the park creatively integrates natural rock outcrops with thickets of trees, massive
                bamboos, with grassy expanse and flowerbeds and the monuments within its limits, regulated by the
                Horticulture Department of the Government of Karnataka. The predominantly green area of the park has
                many motorable roads, and the well-laid-out walking paths running through the park are frequented by
                early morning walkers and the naturalists who study plants in the tranquil natural environment.[5]
                Tourists visiting this park in the city of Bengaluru have nicknamed the city itself as 'Garden City'.[6]

                The importance of the park to the city's environment is best stated by two urban architects who have won
                the national competition to design 'Freedom Park'.

                Access
                The park is accessible from M.G. Road, Kasturba Road, Hudson Circle and Ambedkar Veedhi (Road). The
                motorable roads which run through the park are allowed for light motor vehicles only. All locations of
                the park are accessible through walking paths. The park is open to the public at all times but the roads
                around the park are closed for traffic from 5:00 to 8:00 am every day to provide more safety and fresh
                environment for morning walkers and exercisers and also this park will be closed on every Sundays[7]

                Botanical assets
                Indigenous and exotic botanical species found in the park are about 68 genera and 96 species with a
                total of around 6000 plants/trees. Indigenous species found in the park are:[8] artocarpus, cassia
                fistula, ficus, polyalthias etc., and exotic species such as araucaria, bamboo, castanospermum australe,
                grevillea robusta, millettia, peltophorum, schinus molle, swietenia mahagoni, tabebuia. sp etc.

                Amongst the ornamental and flowering exotic trees lining the roads in the park are the Grevillea robusta
                (silver oak)—the first oaks introduced to Bangalore from Australia[5]—and the delonix or the gulmohar
                tree (bright red flowers with long petals) along the Cubbon road in the park, which is a widely
                cultivated tropical ornamental tree around the world.[9]

                Avenues
                The avenue of araucarias along with canna beds on either sides of the road from the Central Public
                Library to Hudson circle, avenue of Swieteninas in the Northern side of the park, the Java fig avenue
                along the road leading to the Government Museum, polyalthia avenue along the road from Queen Victoria's
                statue to King Edward VII's statue and the chestnut tree avenue from the Chamarajendra statue to
                Siddalingaiah circle are testimony to the botanical richness of the park. Other attractions at the park
                are the Ringwood circle, lotus pond and bamboo grove nook.[5]

                Historical buildings and monuments integral to the park
                The formal gardens, from the central hall of the original Attara Kacheri (means 18 government offices)
                now the Karnataka High Court, extends along the ceal promenade developed symmetrically with avenues, to
                the museum building. Another impressive artistic structure is Iyer Hall, which houses the Central
                Library with a rose garden as a frontage. It is undisputedly the largest public library in the state as
                evidenced by the college students thronging to read here, and has the world's most extensive collection
                of Braille books. Other buildings located within or at the periphery of the park are 1) the Indira
                Priyadarshini Children's Library, 2) the Venkatappa Art Gallery, 3) the Aquarium (stated to be the
                second largest in India), 4) the YMCA, 5) Yuvanika — the State Youth Centre, 6) Century Club, 7) Press
                Club, 8) Jawahar Bal Bhavan, 9) Tennis Pavilion, 10) the Cheshire Dyer Memorial Hall and 11) the Ottawa

            <p>Bannerghatta National Park, Bangalore Overview
                Located 22 km away from Bangalore, the Bannerghatta National Park is a sanctuary for a large variety of
                flora and fauna. Spread over a massive area of around 104.27 sq. km, this national park was established
                in the year 1971. The park itself has a number of establishments within its confines, which includes the
                country's first butterfly park as well.

                Other attractions here are ten Reserve Forests of Anekal Range of the Bangalore Forest Division, an
                aquarium, a zoo, Children's park, Crocodile Farm, Snake Park and Prehistoric Animals' Park. What's more,
                you can get up close and personal with the wondrous wildlife here by the means of a jungle safari, which
                is a popular activity to pursue here. The best part about Bannerghatta National Park is the small
                well-defined zones for animals that almost guarantees that you will spot the animals. People go in caged
                vehicles (buses/safari).

            <p>The two houses of legislature of the princely state of Mysore, the legislative assembly and the
                legislative council, were established in 1881 and 1907 respectively. Sessions of the two houses took
                place in Mysore with joint sessions taking place in the Bangalore Town Hall. After India's independence
                on 15 August 1947, Mysore acceded to India and capital of Mysore state was shifted to Bangalore with the
                two houses moving into Attara Kacheri, a British-built building in Cubbon Park that housed the High
                Court of Mysore.[2] With the need for a more spacious quarters, a new building with two floors to
                accommodate both the houses was planned and the foundation stone of the building was laid by Jawaharlal
                Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India on 13 July 1951.[3] Kengal Hanumanthaiah, who was elected as
                chief minister of Mysore after the 1952 election revised the plan.[4] The new plan included
                accommodating other government offices, archives, a library and a banquet hall in the same building with
                artistic elements added representing the tradition of Mysore state.[3]</p>

            <p>ipu Sultan's Summer Palace, in Bangalore, India, is an example of Indo-Islamic architecture and was
                the summer residence of the Mysorean ruler Tipu Sultan. Hyder Ali commenced its construction within
                the walls of the Bangalore Fort, and it was completed during the reign of Tipu Sultan in 1791. After
                Tipu Sultan's death in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, the British Administration used the palace for
                its secretariat before moving to Attara Kacheri in 1868. Today the Archaeological Survey of India
                maintains the palace, which is located at the center of Old Bangalore near the Kalasipalya bus
                stand, as a tourist spot. Entry fee is ₹20 for Indian citizens, while for foreign visitors is ₹200
                (US$2.50).

                The structure was built entirely of teak and stands adorned with pillars, arches and balconies. It
                is believed that Tipu Sultan used to conduct his durbar (court) from the eastern and western
                balconies of the upper floor. There are four smaller rooms in the corners of first floor which were
                Zenana Quarters. There are beautiful floral motifs embellishing the walls of the palace. The site
                also holds a painting of grand throne visualized by Tipu Sultan himself. Coated with gold sheets and
                adorned with precious emerald stones, Tipu had vowed never to use it until he completely defeated
                the British Army. After Tipu Sultan's death, the British dismantled the throne and auctioned its
                parts as it was too expensive for a single person to buy whole.[citation needed]

                The rooms in the ground floor have been converted into a small museum showcasing various
                achievements of Tipu Sultan and his administration. There are newly done portraits of the people and
                places of that time. There is a replica of Tipu's Tiger, which is in the Victoria and Albert Museum
                in London. Tipu Sultan's clothes and his crown are present in silver and gold pedestals. The silver
                vessels given by a general to Hyder Ali is also displayed.

                The Horticulture Department, Government of Karnataka, maintains the area in front of the palace as a
                garden and lawn</p>

                The splendour of Tipu’s court was reflected in it’s magnificient houses of state, the royal
                residences of Tipu Sultan. We may classify among his residences 4 major palaces and 3 minor ones.

                The palace at Bangalore which still exists today was commenced in 1778 by Haidar Ali and completed
                by Tipu in 1791. The artist Robert Home writes that ‘the palace was grand and spacious, displaying
                to the four winds of heaven as many ample fronts, each composing a lofty hall, the wooden roof of
                which is supported by colonnades of the same material. The pillars are connected by scolloped
                arches; and the whole is superbly painted and gilt. The walls in front of the entrances to the East
                and West halls have balconies, richly carved, and raised by small pillars united by arches.‘ To
                Robert Mackenzie, the palace was ‘the most airy and elegant of any in the East‘, discounting those
                of Delhi and Agra. He greatly admired the paintwork and decoration of flowers in gold leaf, in the
                diwan-i-aam, as well as rich floor carvings and wall hangings, and he found extensive ivory inlay.

            <p>Bangalore Palace is a 19th century royal palace located in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, in an area that
                was owned by the Rev. John Garrett, the first principal of the Central High School in Bangalore, now
                famous as Central College. The commencement of the construction of the palace is attributed to him.The
                palace belongs to Maharaja Biswajit and his wife Maharani PiyalMany international artists have performed
                in the grounds. Today a legal battle between government and the Mysore royal family has seen a ban of
                commercial activities. Nevertheless, a number of private companies controlled by the royal family runs a
                number of wedding halls on the grounds. For the past 34 years the oldest security agency of Karnataka
                named Scorpion Security Ltd has their national headquarters inside the palace premises.

                Over the past few years, the palace grounds have been hosts to major music artists like: Iron Maiden,
                Aerosmith, Backstreet Boys, Bryan Adams, Delirious?, Don Moen, Hillsong United, David Guetta, Elton
                John, Deep Purple, Petra, Textures, Amon Amarth, Lamb of God, Mark Knopfler, Akon, The Black Eyed Peas,
                The Rolling Stones, Sepultura, Mr Big, Metallica, Megadeth, Michael Learns to Rock, Roger Waters, Guns
                N' Roses, The Prodigy, Dream Theater, No Doubt, Sepultura, Scorpions, Enrique Iglesias, Machine Head,
                Cradle of Filth, Jay Sean, Ludacris and Flo Rida.

                Iron Maiden's performance in 2007 was a historic gig named Eddfest in the sub-continent. The concert was
                part of the band's A Matter of Life and Death Tour. The name Eddfest is taken from the band's mascot
                Eddie. The concert is the largest paid concert ever to take place in India with an estimated 38,000
                people in attendance with 4000 people watching from outside the venue without tickets. It marked the
                first visit of Iron Maiden to the Indian subcontinent, and the first major heavy metal concert to take
                place in the country.

                Jay Sean, Ludacris and Flo Rida performed in Palace Grounds on 22 September 2011 for the opening
                ceremony of the Champions League T20.

                Metallica performed at the palace grounds on 30 October 2011 as part of the Rock N India festival, their
                first show in India which was attended by 31,000 people.[2] It would also turn out to be the last
                concert to take place as the state government and police stopped giving permission for any future
                musical events or concerts at the venue (all concerts banned).</p>

            <img src="./cb.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="500px">
            <p>National Gallery of Modern Art is an art gallery in Bangalore. It was inaugurated in the year 2009. It
                showcases modern Indian art and houses paintings by Raja Ravi Verma, Jamini Roy, Amrita Sher-Gil,
                Rabindranath Tagore and a large number of modern and contemporary artists.[1] Equipped with an
                auditorium, a public art reference library, a cafeteria, and a museum shop cum facilitation block, the
                NGMA Bengaluru looks ahead to becoming a hub of art activities and a major cultural centre at Bengaluru.
                The gallery organizes and hosts talks on art and culture by speakers, seminars, film screenings as well
                as workshops and guided walks throughout the year.[2]The gallery was being refurbished in 2006 to open
                as the third site of NGMA. This follows a prolonged period of development and controversy.[3] The
                sprawling, 100 year old Manikyavelu Mansion once belonged to Vilum Manickavelu Mudaliar the, a Yuvaraja
                of Mysore. Mudalier was not born into aristocracy, but rather married into it. He became a successful
                business owner after leasing several manganese and chrome mines on lease. According to the documents in
                the NGMA archives, the building was bought by Mudalier early on in his career. The archivists at the
                NGMA are certain that Mudalier and his family lived in the mansion for quite some years. However, due to
                financial problems, the house was put on auction and was acquired by the City Improvement Trust,
                currently the BDA, and then transferred to the Housing Board in the 1960s. In 2000, the Ministry of
                Kannada and culture sub-leased the mansion to the Ministry of Culture. It became the chosen location for
                the southern centre the NGMA.[4] Restoration began in 2003, and opened on 18 February 2009 under the
                curatorial ship of Sobha Nambisan.[5]</p>
